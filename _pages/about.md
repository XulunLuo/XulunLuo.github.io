I'm a master's student at Carnegie Mellon University and a software engineer focused on interactive and entertainment technologies, bridging film ðŸŽ¬, game design ðŸŽ®, and real-time simulation. 

My work centers on designing robust systems that merge creativity with precision.

With a foundation in both cinematic storytelling and computer science, I thrive at the intersection where engineering meets imagination âœ¨. 

Whether developing cross-platform applications, integrating diverse hardware systems, or building tools that bridge different creative technologies, I aim to make emerging technologies accessible for creators and audiences alike.

**My interests span:**

- ðŸš€ Real-time systems and virtual production
- ðŸŽ® Game-engine / Game Design (Unreal / Unity)
- ðŸ“– Interactive storytelling and experience design

Ultimately, I want to push how we tell stories through technologyâ€”turning research prototypes into tools that empower creative expression across film, XR, and beyond ðŸŒŸ.
